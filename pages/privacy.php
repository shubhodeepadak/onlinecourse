You agree that you will never divulge or share access or access information for your user account with any third party for any reason.

Unless otherwise expressly stated on the GetEducated Site, the texts, exams, video, images, and other instructional materials provided with the courses and programs offered on the GetEducated Site are for your personal use in connection with those courses and programs only.

		<p>Use for Personalization and Pedagogical Improvements.</p>
		<p>Our goal is to provide current and future visitors to the GetEducated Site with the best possible educational experience. To further this goal, we sometimes present different users with different versions of course materials and software. We do this to personalize the experience to the individual learner (to assess the learner’s level of ability and learning style, and present materials best suited to the learner), to improve our understanding of the learning process, and to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of our course materials, payment models, platform features, and offerings. We may publish or otherwise publicize results from this process, but, unless otherwise permitted under the Privacy Policy, those publications or public disclosures will not include your personal information.</p>

		<h3><div id="5">USER POSTINGS</div></h3>
		<p>User Postings Representations and Warranties.</p>
		<p>By submitting or distributing your User Postings, you affirm, represent, and warrant (1) that you have the necessary rights, licenses, consents, and/or permissions to reproduce and publish the User Postings and to authorize GetEducated and its users to reproduce, modify, publish, and otherwise use and distribute your User Postings in a manner consistent with the licenses granted by you below, and (2) that neither your submission of your User Postings nor the exercise of the licenses granted below will infringe or violate the rights of any third party. You, and not GetEducated, are solely responsible for your User Postings and the consequences of posting or publishing them.</p>
		<p>License Grant to GetEducated and the Members.</p>
		<p>By submitting or distributing your User Postings, you hereby grant to GetEducated and the Members (as described below) a worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, assignable, sub licensable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable right and license to host, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, modify, distribute, redistribute, relicense, and otherwise use, make available, and exploit your User Postings, in whole or in part, in any form and in any media formats and through any media channels (now known or hereafter developed).</p>

		<h3><div id="6">CERTIFICATES AND OTHER PRODUCTS & SERVICES</div></h3>
		<p>Generally.</p>
		<p>From time to time, GetEducated and the colleges, universities, and other institutions providing courses and programs on the GetEducated Site (collectively, the "Members") may offer services and products for a fee (for example, course and program certificates). For anything that you choose to purchase on the GetEducated Site, you agree to pay all applicable fees when due. As described in the Privacy Policy, the processing of your payment information is done by a third-party payment vendor, and you will be routed to a secure payment flow controlled by that vendor to complete the payment transaction. Once your payment transaction is completed, an GetEducated confirmation page will be displayed, and you will receive a confirmation email with your name, order number, and the payment amount. Please retain this email for your records as this information will be required if you seek a refund from GetEducated, as described below.</p>
		<p>Certificates.</p>
		<p>GetEducated and the Members may offer Verified Certificates of Achievement for courses (a "Verified Certificate") or certificates for programs (for example, a MicroMasters program certificate) for learners who, in the Members’ judgment, have satisfactorily demonstrated mastery of the course or program material. Certificates will be issued by GetEducated under the name of the underlying Member(s) from where the course or program originated, i.e. HarvardX, MITx, etc. The decision whether a certificate will be awarded to a given learner will be solely within the discretion of the awarding Member.</p>	
		<p>Subject to the foregoing, you will be required to pay a fee and complete the ID verification process for Verified Certificates. In order to authenticate your identity for a Verified Certificate, you will be prompted to take a webcam photo of yourself, as well as a photo of an acceptable form of photo ID (described below). Although these items are collected by GetEducated in accordance with these TOS and the Privacy Policy, you should be aware that the actual authentication of your identity is performed by an GetEducated third-party service provider and this information will be used only for the purpose of verifying your identity. Acceptable forms of photo ID’s are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Government or State-issued driver's license</li>
			<li>Passport</li>
			<li>National ID card</li>
			<li>State or Province ID card (including cards issued by motor vehicle agencies)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In order to be accepted by GetEducated, your photo ID must:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Contain your full name exactly (excluding hyphens, accents, and spaces);</li>
			<li>Contain a relatively current photograph of yourself;</li>
			<li>Be an original document; photocopied documents cannot be accepted; and</li>
			<li>Be current and valid; expired documents cannot be accepted.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Unfortunately, if you do not possess a photo ID meeting the criteria described above, GetEducated is unable to provide you with a Verified Certificate at this time.</p>
		<p>Refunds.</p>
		<p>Certificates and other purchases on the GetEducated Site may be eligible for a refund for a period of time (in each case, the “Refund Period”). The applicable Refund Period for some products and services are described below. To receive a refund during the Refund Period, simply unenroll from the course and the refund will be processed automatically. Refunds will be credited to the payment account used for the purchase and may take up to two billing cycles to process. For more info, visit the GetEducated Help Center. If the applicable Refund Period for a purchase has passed, but you believe a refund is warranted, please submit a support ticket via the Contact us form.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Verified Certificate Track: To receive a refund with respect to your enrollment in the verified certificate track of a course, you have a period of 14 days after your payment or 14 days after your course starts (up to six months after your payment) whichever occurs later, during which you may withdraw or unenroll from the course by clicking on the unenroll link on the learner dashboard.</li>
			<li>Professional Education Courses: To receive a refund with respect to your enrollment in a Professional Education course, you have a period of 2 days after your payment or 2 days after the course starts (up to six months after your payment) whichever occurs later to unenroll from the course by clicking on the unenroll link on the learner dashboard.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For more information about refund options (for example, changing to another course session), you should visit the GetEducated Help Center.</p>
		<p>Coupon codes and other course entitlements are subject to expiration and any other conditions stated at the time of purchase.</p>
		<p>No Other Enrollment.</p>
		<p>Solely as a result of enrolling in or completing a course or program provided by a Member through GetEducated: (1) you will not be an applicant for admission to, or enrolled in, any degree or other credit- or credential-bearing program of such Member; and (2) you will not be entitled to use any of the resources of such Member beyond the online courses or programs provided on the GetEducated Site and will not be eligible to receive student privileges or benefits provided to students enrolled in degree or other credit- or credential-bearing programs of the Member.</p>
